      script: `Welcome, beautiful soul. Find a comfortable position where you won't be disturbed.
Close your eyes gently... and take a deep breath in through your nose...
Hold it for a moment... and slowly release through your mouth.

As Dolores Cannon taught us, you are an eternal soul having a temporary human experience.
Your consciousness is infinite. Your essence is timeless.

Let's begin the countdown induction that will guide you to the theta state...
where you can access your deepest wisdom and soul memories.

Number 10... Feel your body beginning to relax. Release any tension in your shoulders.
Number 9... Your breathing becomes slow and natural. You are safe. You are loved.
Number 8... Sinking deeper now... deeper into peace... deeper into your true self.
Number 7... Your mind is quiet. Your body is at ease. You are moving beyond the physical.
Number 6... Halfway there. Feel yourself floating... weightless... free.
Number 5... Deeper still. Accessing the quantum field where all possibilities exist.
Number 4... Your higher self is present. You are never alone. You are always guided.
Number 3... Almost there. The veil between worlds grows thin. You remember who you truly are.
Number 2... So close now. You feel the infinite love of source energy surrounding you.
Number 1... You have arrived. You are in the sacred space of soul remembrance.

You are now connected to your Higher Self... that aspect of you that knows everything...
sees everything... and loves you unconditionally.

In this space, you remember your eternal nature. You are not just this body.
You are not just this lifetime. You are a magnificent soul on an infinite journey.

You have lived many lives. You will live many more.
Each experience adds to the richness of your soul's evolution.

Right now, in this moment, feel the truth of your eternal existence.
You chose to be here. You chose this life. You chose these challenges as opportunities for growth.

Your soul is ancient and wise. It remembers everything.
And it has brought you to this very moment for a reason.

Take a few moments now in silence... to receive any messages...
any insights... any healing your soul wishes to share with you.

Pause for reflection.

When you're ready, know that you can return to this sacred space anytime.
Your higher self is always available. You simply need to ask.

Now, let's begin the journey back. Bringing all this wisdom with you.
Counting from 1 to 5, returning to the present moment.

1... Beginning to return. Feeling the weight of your body.
2... Energy flowing back into your limbs. You remember where you are.
3... Taking a deep breath. Wiggling your fingers and toes.
4... Almost back now. Feeling refreshed, renewed, and deeply connected.
5... Eyes open. Welcome back, eternal soul. You are forever changed by this experience.`,

      script: `Welcome to this journey through the quantum field...
where infinite possibilities exist... where parallel realities await your awareness.

Close your eyes and breathe deeply.
With each breath, you expand beyond the limitations of this single timeline.

You are more than you think you are. You exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously.
In the quantum field, all versions of you are real. All timelines are accessible.

Imagine now that you're standing at the center of an infinite web of light.
Each strand connects to a different version of your life... a different choice... a different outcome.

Can you feel it? The vastness of your existence?
You are not limited to this one reality. You are infinite consciousness experiencing itself.

Now, connect with the version of you in a parallel world where your deepest desire has already manifested.
That reality exists right now. You don't have to create it. You simply tune into its frequency.

What does that version of you feel like? How do they move through the world?
What energy do they emanate? Let yourself embody that frequency now.

As Dolores taught us, the quantum field responds to your consciousness.
Your observation collapses the wave function. Your awareness creates reality.

You are not a victim of circumstances. You are the creator of your experience.

Now, feel the presence of Divine Source energy...
the infinite intelligence that flows through all things... including you.

You are not separate from Source. You ARE Source, experiencing itself in human form.
Feel that connection now. Feel the unconditional love. Feel the infinite wisdom.

You are held. You are guided. You are deeply, profoundly loved.

In this space, ask your Higher Self: What timeline am I meant to align with?
What frequency will serve my highest evolution?

Listen. Receive. Trust what comes.

Pause for integration.

As we prepare to return, know that you've just shifted timelines.
The version of you that entered this meditation is not the same version leaving it.

You are forever changed by your awareness of the quantum field.
You now know the truth: All realities exist. You choose which one to experience.

Gently returning now... bringing this cosmic awareness with you...
Ready to manifest from your soul's truth. Eyes open when you're ready.`,

      script: `Welcome to this sacred QHHT past life regression journey.

You are about to access memories that your soul has carried across lifetimes.
These are not fantasies. They are real experiences from your eternal journey.

Take three deep breaths... and with each exhale, release your attachment to this current identity.
You are so much more than this name... this body... this lifetime.

Counting down now from 10 to 1, going deeper into the theta state.

10... 9... 8... Releasing... 7... 6... 5... Deeper... 4... 3... 2... 1...
You are in the perfect state to access your soul's memories.

Now, I'm going to count from 3 to 1, and when I reach 1, you will find yourself in another lifetime.
A lifetime that is significant for your current soul journey. A lifetime you need to remember right now.

3... Moving back through time... beyond this life... beyond birth...
2... Your consciousness is traveling... finding the perfect lifetime to explore...
1... You are there. Look down at your feet. What are you wearing?

Notice your surroundings. Where are you? What year is it? What is your name?

Allow the memories to flow naturally. You are safe. You are simply observing.

Move forward to a significant day in that life. A day that shaped your soul's journey. What is happening?

Feel the emotions. Understand the lessons. This is why you're here.

Now, move to the last day of that lifetime. How do you transition?
What does your soul learn from this death? There is no fear. Only understanding.

As your consciousness leaves that body, you float above it.
From this higher perspective, what do you understand now? What pattern are you seeing?

Move now to the space between lives... the sacred realm where souls rest and plan.
You are meeting with your guides... with the Council of Elders.

What do they want you to know about that lifetime? What lesson is being carried into your current life?

Listen deeply. This is why you're experiencing certain challenges now.
You're completing old soul contracts. You're healing ancient wounds.

Receive the wisdom. Receive the healing. Feel the integration happening now.

When you're ready, your guides will show you how this past life connects to your current purpose.
Why you chose this specific family... this specific time... this specific mission.

You are beginning to see the bigger picture. Your soul's journey across time.
Each lifetime adds to your evolution. Nothing is random. Everything has meaning.

Thank your guides. Thank that past life version of yourself for the courage to experience what was necessary.

Now, gently returning to the present moment, bringing all this wisdom with you.
Counting from 1 to 5.

1... Returning... 2... Integrating the healing... 3... Feeling your body...
4... Bringing the awareness... 5... Eyes open. Forever changed by what you've remembered.`,

Your Higher Self. Some call it the Subconscious. Some call it the Oversoul.

This is the aspect of you that chose this lifetime.
That knows why you're here. That has all the answers you seek.

Breathe deeply and let go of your conscious mind. Your Higher Self can only come through when you step aside.

Imagine yourself walking down a beautiful path in nature.
Each step takes you closer to a meeting with your Higher Self.

You see a sacred space ahead... a temple... a garden... whatever feels right to you.
This is where your Higher Self waits for you.

As you enter this sacred space, you feel overwhelming love. Unconditional acceptance.
And there, before you, is a being of pure light. This is YOU. The real you. The eternal you.

Your Higher Self speaks: "I have been with you always. In every moment. Through every lifetime.
I am so proud of your courage. So grateful for your willingness to experience this human journey."

Ask your Higher Self: Why did I choose this lifetime? What is my soul's purpose?

Listen. The answer may come as words... as images... as feelings. Trust what you receive.

Ask: What do I need to know right now? What guidance do you have for me?

Your Higher Self responds with infinite wisdom. This part of you sees the bigger picture.
Knows the divine timing of everything. Understands that all is unfolding perfectly.

Ask: What blocks am I ready to release? What healing is available to me now?

Feel the energy shifting. Your Higher Self is already healing you.
Releasing old patterns. Clearing karmic debris. Activating your highest potential.

Ask: How can I better align with my soul's path? What actions should I take?

Receive the guidance. Trust it. Your Higher Self would never steer you wrong.

Now, your Higher Self offers you a gift. A symbol... an object... an energy transmission.
Something to remind you that you are never alone. What is this gift?

Receive it with gratitude. This is yours to keep. A direct connection to your Higher Self.

Your Higher Self speaks one more time: "Remember who you are.
You are eternal. You are powerful. You are love itself. I am always with you.
Simply quiet your mind and call upon me. I will answer."

Thank your Higher Self. Begin the journey back down the path, bringing all this wisdom with you.

You are returning to your physical body now, but you are changed.
You have remembered the truth. You are never separate from your Higher Self.

Eyes open when you're ready. You now know the way home.`,

In the QHHT protocol, the subconscious has the ability to heal anything...
if it's appropriate and for your highest good.

Your body is infinitely intelligent. Every cell holds consciousness.
And right now, we're going to communicate with that cellular intelligence.

Relax deeply. Enter the theta state where healing happens spontaneously.

10... 9... 8... Deeper... 7... 6... 5... More relaxed... 4... 3... 2... 1... Perfect.

Now, bring your awareness to the top of your head.
Ask your Higher Self to scan your body... to show you where energy is blocked...
where healing is needed... where old emotions are stored.

Moving down slowly through your head... your brain... your eyes... your jaw.
Release any tension. Allow healing light to flow through.

Down through your throat. This is the throat chakra... the center of communication.
Have you been speaking your truth? If not, feel the blockage releasing now.

Into your shoulders. So much responsibility is carried here.
Let it go. You don't have to carry the world. Healing light dissolves the burden.

Your heart space. The center of love. Have you been protecting your heart?
It's safe to open now. Feel any walls dissolving. Let love flow in and out freely.

Your solar plexus. Your power center. Any trauma stored here from this life or past lives...
it's being cleared now. You reclaim your power. You are sovereign.

Your sacral chakra. Creation. Relationships. Emotions.
Any wounds from betrayal... from loss... from abandonment... they are healing now.

Your root chakra. Safety. Security. Belonging. You are safe. You are provided for.
You belong to the Earth and to the cosmos. Both are your home.

Now, ask your Higher Self: Is there a specific area that needs extra attention?

Focus healing light on that area. Ask: What caused this imbalance?
What emotion is stored here? What message does my body have for me?

Listen to your body's wisdom. It knows exactly what it needs.

Imagine now that healing beings surround you. The Council of Elders.
Angelic healers. Master healers from other dimensions. They are working on you now.

Feel their hands moving energy... extracting what no longer serves...
infusing you with crystalline light... activating your body's natural healing capacity.

You are being restored to your divine blueprint. The perfect template of health.

Stay in this healing space as long as needed. Integration is happening at the deepest level.

Pause for deep healing.

As we prepare to complete this session, know that the healing continues.
Your body has remembered how to heal itself. The process is activated.

Drink plenty of water. Rest if needed. Allow the integration.

Gently returning now... bringing perfect health with you...
Counting from 1 to 5... Feeling better than you have in years.

1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Eyes open. You are healed. You are whole. You are divine.`,
