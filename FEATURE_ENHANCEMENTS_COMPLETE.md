## 💡 Implementation Highlights

### Best Code Practices:
```typescript

useEffect(() => {
  loadAudio();
  return () => {
    AudioService.unload();
    AudioService.stopSpeech();
  };
}, []);

// Optimized animations
Animated.timing(pulseAnim, {
  toValue: 1.2,
  duration: 2000,
  useNativeDriver: true, // 60fps!
})

// Type-safe services
export class MeditationScriptService {
  static getScriptById(id: string): MeditationScript | undefined {
    return this.getAllScripts().find((script) => script.id === id);
  }
}
```
